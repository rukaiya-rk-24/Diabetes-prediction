# Diabetes-prediction
The following model aims at predicting the probabilty that a person is suffering from diabetes, given his blood sugar values, insulin levels. etc.
The data has been taken from kaggle and can befound here https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmetcankaraolan/diabetes-prediction-using-machine-learning
The model is able to predict the values with an accuracy of 98%.
The EDA of the dataset is carried out to make sure the data is upto the mark.
The model comprises of 4 Dense kayers with Sigmoid function as the activation function in the last layer.
The model uses RMSprop as the optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy as its loss function.
